# Challenge
__How can we help tech-aware people to distinguish real from fake online content by empowering them with effortless independent tools to spot deepfakes (image, video, audio, text) which pollute or cause harm in their information consumption and especially when there is uncertainty such as Covid-19, political elections, war, economic recession, etc. instead of being manipulated by or unintentionally perpetuating misinformation?__

# Sub-questions
 - How can we design a system of rewards and incentives for sharing accurate information online?
 - How can we inspire tech-savvy people to use the deep fake alert tool frequently?
 - How can we create a data visualization function for user feedback and reflection?
